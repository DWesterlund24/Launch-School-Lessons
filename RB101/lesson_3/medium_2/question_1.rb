    a_outer has a value of 42 and an object_id

  Inside the block
    a_outer_inner id will be the same id as a_outer

    a_outer will then be reassigned with a value of 22 and a new object_id

    a_inner will then be assigned the same value and object id as a_outer

  Inside the block
    b_outer_inner id will be the same id as b_outer

    b_outer will then be reassigned with a value of "thirty three" and a new object_id

    b_inner will then be assigned the same value and object id as b_outer

    d_outer will then be reassigned with a value of 44 and a new object_id

    d_inner will then be assigned the same value as c_inner[0], 44, but will have the same object_id as d_outer
