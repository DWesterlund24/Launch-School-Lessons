# How we can find out what a method does should be simple, look at the documentation.
# Though I suppose what might be less simple, is where you find that method in the
# documentation. It could either be under the class you are working with, in the
# parent of that class, or in a module accessible by that class. In this case it is
# in the class we are working with.

# Hash#shift will remove the first key, value pair from the hash and that pair
# will be the returned value.
