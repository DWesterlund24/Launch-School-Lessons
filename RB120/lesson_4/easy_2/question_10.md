# Benefits of OO Programming in Ruby

- More Organic Structure
- Easier to organize and locate specific methods and variables
- Easier to avoid repetitious coding
- Can move modules and classes to new projects if desired, much easier than moving individual methods one at a time
- Can make it easier to plan or PEDAC a program
- Easier to pass infromation into methods, instead of several variables, we can pass in custom objects
